# Brainnest week-4 JavaScript assignment, Game project

Hello my name is Paul'ius and this project is meant to show case how I completed [**'Brainnest'**](https://www.brainnest.consulting/) frontend programs week 4(which was about JS and DOM) upgrade to week 3 game(rock, paper, scissors) adding UI with only JavaScript and not using HTML project.

Techniques used is pure **JavaScript** without classes and methods, just pure functions and DOM manipulation methods. Like _createElement_, _appendChild_, styling also only via JS.

Design personal preference.

### Game assignment key points:

---

1. In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than
   typing their answer in a prompt.
2. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call
   your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
   (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
3. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
4. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5
   points.

### My personal additions:

---

- Design
- Text color changes depend on Win/Loss/Tie
- Reset button(if player eager to start over)
